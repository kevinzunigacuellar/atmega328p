description: Setting up the development environment for ATmega328P

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To simplify getting started with the ATmega328P, we recommend using a development board like the Arduino Uno instead of wiring the microcontroller directly to a breadboard. This allows you to focus on learning the basics of programming and interfacing with the microcontroller without worrying about the hardware setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Arduino Uno board
- A USB cable to connect the Arduino Uno to your computer
- VSCode or another text editor of your choice
- Basic knowledge of C programming

## Installation

To set up your development environment, use Homebrew to install the `avr-gcc` toolchain. Run the following commands:

```zsh
tap osx-cross/avr
brew install avr-gcc avrdude avr-binutils
```

This installs the following tools:

- **`avr-gcc`**: The GNU Compiler Collection tailored for AVR microcontrollers, allowing you to compile C or C++ code into machine code for AVR devices.
- **`avrdude`**: A utility for uploading compiled programs to AVR microcontrollers, facilitating communication through interfaces such as USB or serial.
- **`avr-binutils`**: Essential binary utilities (assembler, linker, and object file manipulation tools) designed for AVR development, complementing `avr-gcc` to process and link your code.

## Project structure

A typical project structure for an ATmega328P project might look like this:

<FileTree>
- .vscode
  - c_cpp_properties.json
- src
  - main.c
- Makefile
</FileTree>

In this structure:

- `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` contains the VSCode configuration settings. 
- `src/main.c` is the main source file for your project.
- `Makefile` is used to build and upload your project to the Arduino Uno.

### Configuring VSCode

To configure VSCode for AVR development, add the following settings to your `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file:

```json title=".vscode/c_cpp_properties.json"
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Mac",
      "includePath": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/src/**",
        "/usr/local/Cellar/avr-gcc/*/lib/avr-gcc/*/avr/include"
      ],
      "defines": ["__AVR_ATmega328P__"],
      "compilerPath": "/opt/homebrew/bin/avr-gcc"
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```

This configuration specifies where VSCode can find the AVR libraries and includes the necessary paths for the ATmega328P microcontroller.

### Build and upload using Makefile

To build and upload your code to the Arduino Uno, you will need to compile your code using `avr-gcc` and upload it to the board using `avrdude`. To simplify this process, you can use the `Makefile` provided below:

```makefile title="Makefile"
# Device configuration
MCU = atmega328p
F_CPU = 16000000UL

# Build tools and flags
CC = avr-gcc
OBJCOPY = avr-objcopy
SIZE = avr-size
CFLAGS = -Os -DF_CPU=$(F_CPU) -mmcu=$(MCU)

# Directory structure
BUILD_DIR = build
SRC_DIR = src
$(shell mkdir -p $(BUILD_DIR))

# Project configuration
TARGET = firmware
SRCS = $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/*.c)
OBJS = $(SRCS:$(SRC_DIR)/%.c=$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o)

# Upload configuration (for Arduino Uno)
PROGRAMMER = arduino
BAUDRATE = 115200
PORT = /dev/tty.usbmodem*

# build the program
all: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).hex size

$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: $(SRC_DIR)/%.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

$(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).elf: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

$(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).hex: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).elf
	$(OBJCOPY) -O ihex -R .eeprom $< $@

size: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).elf
	$(SIZE) --format=avr --mcu=$(MCU) $<

flash: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).hex
	avrdude -p $(MCU) -c $(PROGRAMMER) -P $(PORT) -b $(BAUDRATE) -U flash:w:$<

clean:
	rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)

.PHONY: all flash clean
```

This `Makefile` automates the build process by compiling your code, generating the `.hex` file, and uploading it to the Arduino Uno board.

- To build your project, run `make`.
- To upload your project to the Arduino Uno, run `make flash`.
- To clean the build directory, run `make clean`.
